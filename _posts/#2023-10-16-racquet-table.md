## Racquet Table

>[]TODO: Use bs4 and scrapy to pull data from websites like tennisonly and regex to store in a .json file. Looks like tennis university has a pretty complete list of racquets though
>[]TODO: python script to generate below table
>[]TODO: Add scripting to make table interactable and auto update. UPDATE: don't think I can do this see below
>[]TODO: since i can't or don't know how to incorporate active table sorting for a GitHubs page just have the script generate (No. of Headers) x 2 pages for table sorted to each column asc/desc
